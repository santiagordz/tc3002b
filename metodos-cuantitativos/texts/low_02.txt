Artificial Intelligence—AI—is rewriting the rules of the modern world. It’s tech that lets machines act smart, doing things like learning, reasoning, or deciding, just like us humans. Born from computer science, it’s about creating brainy machines. It’s hitting every corner of life, and students need to get the scoop on it.

AI’s doing cool stuff. In hospitals, it’s catching diseases early. On roads, it’s steering driverless cars. It’s picking your next Netflix show or making video games epic. Even in class, it’s helping kids learn their way. It’s a speed demon with data and saves lives by being spot-on, but it’s got baggage—think job cuts or data creeps. AI’s a powerhouse, but it’s on us to keep it in check.
